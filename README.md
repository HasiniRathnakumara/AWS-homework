First I logged into cloud academy snd learned lessions under the videos.Then I created an account in Amazon Web Service and logged into it.I did practicels in AWS which relavent to cloud academy practicles.

The most challange I faced was to record the practicels I was doing.So I underwent so many softwares which would satisfy my problem.Finally I found the solution in Camtasia Studio which record my studies very well

The six practicles I underwent as follows

1. Create your first Amazon EC2 instance (Linux)

The problems I faced during not having linux version was solved by using putty instead.This was a really amazing opportunity for us to work with cloud academy.They were much user friendly and can understand what to do very clearly.
